# MATLAB Bug: Missing Case in Conditional Logic

This repository demonstrates a common, subtle bug in MATLAB code involving incomplete conditional logic.  The `myFunction` function correctly handles cases where the input `x` is greater than 10 or less than 0. However, it fails to explicitly handle the case where `x` equals 10, leading to potential unexpected behavior and errors.

The solution provided addresses this by explicitly including the case where `x` equals 10, making the function's behavior clear and predictable.
